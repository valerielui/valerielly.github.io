                <p class="project-text"><a href="https://tfhk.org" target="_blank">Teach For Hong Kong</a> is a non-profit organization that tackles the issue of education inequality in Hong Kong through its <a href="https://tfhkfellowship.org" target="_blank">Fellowship program</a>. As part of the program, Fellows participate in a year-long teaching placement where they expand educational opportunities for grassroot students through teaching classes and organizing extracurriculars. Through ideating and implementing these experiences, Fellows also help foster students' development of important soft skills to better prepare them for their future academic endeavors.</p>

                <p class="work-category">what i did:</p>
                <p class="project-text">Over winter break, I interned with Teach For Hong Kong’s Brand and Growth team and supported their recruitment and outreach efforts by helping to <b>revamp their Fellowship recruitment website and create landing pages</b>. As part of the project, I also helped <b>create graphics to support information on the website, optimize UI/UX and webpage speeds</b>.</p>

                <p class="work-category">reflection:</p>
                <p class="project-text">Unfortunately, the work I completed in the duration of this internship is protected by an NDA so I will be speaking on my experience and some lessons I have learned throughout the short few weeks at TFHK!
                <br><br>
                To start, I am so grateful for this opportunity to have been a part of the team at Teach For Hong Kong. It was an amazing experience working alongside inspiring individuals who are as passionate about education inequality and social impact as I am. Given that this was also my first internship, I am also especially grateful that I was able to contribute to the organization by taking on very hands-on and impactful projects throughout the internship.</p>

                <p class="work-category">some things I learned:</p>
                <p class="project-text"><b>Marketing!</b>
                <br>
                Although the majority of my internship focused more so on designing, I picked up many valuable insights about Marketing, like what landing pages are and how they help increase engagement! Recognizing I had interests in Marketing, I was also provided with opportunities to participate in company meetings where I learned about the organization's execution of growth strategies and crafting of their messaging.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="project-text"><b>Being responsive</b>
                <br>
                Since the internship was conducted over a hybrid format due to COVID, team communications relied heavily on Slack, which posed a great challenge especially when immediate feedback was needed. Therefore, I learned to make more of a conscious effort to look out for new notifications on a regular basis throughout the day to stay updated on my team’s progress or any important information!</p>
                <br>    
                <p class="project-text"><b>Web design</b>
                <br>One of the biggest aspects of my role at TFHK was web design, which I had limited experience with prior to this internship. This role really pushed me out of my comfort zone as I had no experience with Squarespace and had to quickly learn to use the website builder as I had fast-approaching deadlines to meet at the time. Besides that, I was also challenged by having to explore dfferent ways to present information on a webpage professionally and aesthetically to convey information effectively. Ultimately, I was successful in challenging myself as I created many pages I'm extremely satisfied with! Through this process, I also picked up insight about structures of webpages, like the “hero” and “call to action” sections, which I have definitely leveraged in my design of this website. :)</p>
