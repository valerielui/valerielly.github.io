                <p class="work-category">project introduction:</p>
                <p class="project-text">Electrical appliances are used all year round in schools, offices, and homes. As a result of our frequent usage of these appliances, infrastructures like the aforementioned consume large amounts of energy on a yearly basis. Therefore, as a solution, I have designed a smart thermostat that can be used in a proposed classroom to minimize our energy consumption, thus helping to reduce expenses on energy bills.</p>
                
                <div class="project-space"></div>
                
                <p class="work-category">opportunity analysis:</p>
                <p class="project-text">To start, I conducted research into existing thermostats on the market and surveyed my target consumers on qualities they look for in my product. Starting with my research on existing thermostats, I noticed that <b>most thermostats on the market tended to prioritize functionality with simple UI over the overall aesthetic of the thermostat</b>. I identified Nest's Learning Thermostat and the Ween thermostat as the only thermostats on the market that not only prioritized functionality with intuitive UI, but also an aesthetic design that complements consumers' homes. However, due to their unique designs, I also noticed that they were priced significantly higher than other thermostats on the market. Therefore, I set out to create my own version of a thermostat that was not only equally as simplistic by design, but also functional in that its features were comprehensive to my user.</p>

                <p class="work-category">initial designs:</p>
                <p class="project-text" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Based on the research and inspiration I have gathered, I came up with the following initial designs (shown as CAD models).</p>

                <p class="work-category">final design:</p>
                <p class="project-text" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">After reviewing my initial designs, I developed a final design which involved a better solution for the placement of the LED light. This included the development of a piece of acrylic with holes on the bottom to slot LED lights into to keep them in place, as well as the creation of a stand where the piece of acrylic could be placed on to not only keep them in place but also provide strengthened support to the LED light.</p>

                            <br>The first step I took after deciding on my final design was soldering wires, resistors, and a temperature sensor to my chip to add functionality to my soon-to-be-created thermostat.</li>

                            <br>Then, I 3D printed a mockup of my final design to test its feasibility. This part proved to be extremely helpful as I soon realized that I designed the thermostat’s size to be far too small, and was unable to even fit in the chip.</li>

                            <br>Now identifying issues with my existing design, I made modifications to my CAD model to ensure it was feasible. During this part of the process, my main issue was the thermostat’s physical size, therefore I increased the width and height of the model as a solution to this issue.</li>

                            <br>After all of the previous steps were ready, I worked on coding my LED light to display different colors of light under different temperature conditions. Here is the code I wrote in Scratch which turned the LED’s color red or blue depending on whether the detected temperature was above or below 22 degrees Celsius.</li>
