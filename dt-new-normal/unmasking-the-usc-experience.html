        <p>A little more than three months ago, and after more than a full year in lockdown, USC students set foot on the once-barren University Park Campus. Since then, activity has increased tenfold with in-person classes, packed sporting games and on-campus housing. While some have taken little haste with their newfound freedoms and readily reintegrated back into campus life, others have remained cautious and reserved, cognizant of coronavirus restrictions and the state of the world. The strange semester has also marked many firsts for students, faculty and staff. Many underclassmen have experienced campus life for the first time as they navigate both college living and a new environment. Professors have modified their teaching techniques, operating the classrooms in hybrid with in-person students as well as Zoom participants. Faculty have been tasked in ensuring the usage of Trojan Check, protecting the USC community through a daily health self-diagnosis.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As a whole, the USC community has begun to grapple with the postpandemic world. Here are some of the experiences of students, faculty and staff from this semester captured by <em>Daily Trojan</em> photographers.</p>

It’s terrifying for me because my nose is so sensitive, and every time I do the test, it makes me so uncomfortable.','Yanhan Wang','Pursuing master’s degree in electrical engineering'],
                           ['Q: What has been one negative or something that’s been hard to adjust to?','A: For me, it’s just my comfort level. I’m still very paranoid about taking off my mask, even if I’m outside. I still have that anxiety about fully coming back to school and assimilating back to normal. That’s probably been one of the hardest things. I try to limit my social activity, and I’m trying to find ways to still stay safe during the pandemic.','Emily Marroquin','Rising senior majoring in communication'],
                           ['Q: What are specific things you are doing to make those adjustments to overcome the challenges or try to do more exciting things?',"A: I try and say “Hi” to as many people as I can when I'm just walking and passing by. I also try to force myself to go to as many club meetings as possible. Sometimes I'll feel a little stressed or tired and I don't want to go, but I know at the end of the day, those are the events that are going to I'm going to remember and not me sitting in my room.", 'Matthew Quintana', 'Rising junior double majoring in business administration and economics'],
                           ['Q: What was the hardest part about coming back to campus this semester?','A: Probably reconnecting with students because our freshman year was cut abruptly. Everyone’s still trying to figure out what clubs and activities they want to be involved in.','Vinny Musunuri','Rising senior majoring in business administration'],
                           ['Q: How has adjusting to an in-person, on-campus semester been?','A: I prefer in person because that’s just who I am. I’m very personable and just to make the kids feel comfortable coming back after being on a whole year hiatus without being around anyone, I want them to feel that much love when it comes to me here at Building 9 [in Cowlings and Ilium].','Leticia Bradley','USC Housing Worker'],['Q: What was the most fun part about college this semester?','A: Honestly when you’re done with work and you take a tiny break to go to your friends room or you go outside to take a walk with your friends.','Yifei Lu','Rising sophomore majoring in business administration'],
                           ['Q: What has been the most fun part about coming back?',"A: Getting back to being with people, collaborating on design and fun projects, and hands-on work — not just staring at a screen — has been really, really great. It's what I was missing the most when we were on Zoom.",'Kate Schaaf','Rising junior majoring in theatre (design)'],['Q: How has adjusting to an in person, on-campus semester been?',"A: Kind of hard to be honest but I think it’s getting better. I’m glad that we got the Pass/No Pass. I also like the in-person office hours; it's more helpful.",'Juliana Samayoa Cobon','Rising junior majoring in computational linguistics'],
                           ['Q: What was the most fun part of an in person, on-campus semester?','A: The funnest part has been meeting new people again. Being home wasn’t fun so being back here, seeing people — old people and new people — has been my favorite part.','Jamal Seriki','Rising senior majoring in international relations and the global economy'],
                           ['Q: How has adjusting to an in person, on-campus semester been?','A: I’ve kept a lot of mementos that reminded me of home. That might not be the best thing to do because some people might be too focused on home but having the right amount of things. I brought one of my favorite blankets back with me and just small things like that help keep me grounded. It reminds me that I may be gone and I may be in this new chapter of my life, but I still have these old pieces with me to ground me.','Halla Ibrahim','Rising sophomore majoring in biological sciences'],
                           ['Q: How has adjusting to an in-person, on-campus semester been?',"A: I think it’s difficult wearing a mask all the time — being in class and having a mask on and not being able to hear people across the room. Also all the COVID restrictions that prevent you from hanging out with people as much as you want, and even with the guest policy it's still somewhat hard bringing people over. But, I mean, I'm still having a college experience so far so it's not that big of a barrier.",'Hannah Ko','Rising sophomore majoring in health and human sciences'],
                           ['Q: What has been one negative or something that’s been hard to adjust to?','A: There are benefits to online, and I felt that Zoom brought all students closer to me. Because I tend to teach large classes on Zoom, it made everyone seem like they were sitting right next to me. I could see the name of the student but also students who might not have participated before actually engaged a lot either via chat or talked or any of those things.','Professor Carmen Lee','Clinical associate professor of communication, assistant dean for excellence in teaching'],            
                           ['Q: What has been the most challenging or difficult part about coming back to campus this semester?','A: I’m an RA [in Cowlings], and I would say the hardest thing is getting people to engage. Coming back from a year of being at home and social distancing, it’s hard to get students to come back and want to get that school spirit back and want to join events, have fun, meet other people they don’t know.','Dylan Roberts','Rising junior majoring intelligence and cyber operations'],
                           ['Q: What was the most exciting or fun part about returning to school?','A: Seeing everyone I met online in person. I joined a few clubs online and I was able to get to know them online, but it was really cool being able to finally see them face to face.','Angela Xuan','Rising junior majoring in cognitive science'],
                           ['Q: What’s been hard about being on campus vs. online school?','A: Being on campus means that you have to wake up earlier than you normally would and that you’re having to block out your schedule more so than online school. So it’s just more exhausting.','Jonny Blando','Rising sophomore majoring in film and TV production'],
                           ['Q: What was the hardest part about coming back to campus this semester?','A: The biggest thing is school and time management. Especially being a freshman coming out of high school and going online for my last one to one and a half years, coming back to campus and managing my time and figuring out the balance of school, and life was a little bit harder.','Badruddin Mahamed','Rising sophomore majoring in human biology']];
